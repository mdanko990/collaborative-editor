Build completely on Next.js with server.js to represent backend part for socket.io. Currently functionality is basic, aimed to see how socket.io works and to play with events.
In future backend may be separated to enable deployment on Vercel.
Also I am planning to add more field and follow editing on each field and add a rich text editor

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
